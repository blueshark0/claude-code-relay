• I'm examining how the sliding window uses minute-level keys and noticing it mostly cycles between just two minute keys because of its resolution. I'm also checking
how missing Redis keys are handled in pipelines and considering concurrency concerns in the token tracking. Finally, I'm questioning whether the RateLimitEndTime
field is fully integrated in the account model or if it needs further confirmation.

• I'm studying the concurrency handling and rate limiting logic in rpm_tpm_service.go, spotting major bugs like duplicated minute-key reads causing 60x inflated counts
and race conditions from non-atomic Redis increments; these issues mean the concurrency safeguards likely fail, so I'll highlight these critical flaws and their
implications.

• I’m noting critical Go compile errors from unused imports and variables, plus duplicated DB migration scripts that could break migrations. There’s also a concurrency
bug with sliding window timing in stats recording, plus some service and controller logic gaps. I’m checking imports and code details to highlight these core problems
clearly.

• Explored
└ Read claude.go, claude_console.go, HistoryChart.vue

• I’m inspecting concurrency concerns and code issues like unused variables causing compile errors in key service functions. There are also inefficiencies causing high
CPU and Redis loads, and some logging and struct usage that need alignment. I’m focusing on major problems to highlight for the user before updating the plan.

• I’m gathering a detailed list of critical problems including build-breaking compile errors, migration duplicates causing failures, major concurrency bugs inflating
rate limits due to sliding-window logic, front-end data mismatches on TPM stats, and inefficient heavy loops in background jobs. These findings will be prioritized
by severity with precise file and line references, followed by open questions on concurrency enforcement expectations and a brief change summary. This sets me up to
prepare a clear, structured code review-style report matching the user’s requested format and language.

• I'll organize the final Chinese response as requested, using bullet points with file references and line numbers, highlighting main issues like build failures due
to unused imports and variables, duplication in migrations, and concurrency bugs with sliding window logic. I’ll also suggest clarifying questions about concurrency
enforcement and schema confirmation, plus mention the missing tests and RESTful concerns. This way, the user gets a clear and structured overview with actionable
points.

> 发现

- service/rpm_tpm_service.go:189 当前滑动窗口统计在 60 次循环内使用到同一“分钟”键，导致同一 Redis 键被重复读取并累加 30~60 次，RPM/TPM 会被成倍放大，实际限流与审计结
  果完全失真（等同于随时触发或永远达不到真实阈值）。
- service/rpm_tpm_service.go:9 与 service/rpm_tpm_service.go:609 分别存在未使用的 math 导入及 ctx/cutoffTime 变量，go build 会直接报错中止。
- controller/rpm_tpm_controller.go:509 声明了 rpmTpmService 却未使用，同样导致编译失败。
- migrations/add_account_limits.sql:6 与 migrations/add_total_limit_fields.sql:6 试图新增项目中已存在的 daily_limit/total_limit/total_cost 字段，迁移执行会报
  「Duplicate column name」，阻断部署。
- web/src/components/rpm-tpm/RealTimeStats.vue:167 使用 computed 却未消费返回值，导致 updateLastRefreshTime 只在挂载时触发，实时刷新时间戳不会随新数据更新。
- web/src/pages/accounts/list/index.vue:152 & web/src/pages/accounts/list/index.vue:771 模板期望 row.tpm_stats，但数据加载只填充 rpm_stats，前端 TPM 列和告警始终显
  示“暂无数据”。

开放问题

- 需要确认是否计划采用 Redis 脚本或其他原子方式在检查限流时同步自增计数，以避免多并发同时放行的竞态。

补充说明

- 以上问题在解决前无法验证 RPM/TPM 并发审计方案，建议先修复编译错误和核心统计逻辑后再补充端到端验证。
